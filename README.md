# PRODUCT: Building Product Ontology

This branch contains a proposal for a novel lightweight building product ontology. The ontology only contains two classes and two object properties. The ontology is aligned to BOT and to schema.org.

## Product 4 Building ontology

As one taxonomy to further specify PRODUCT ontology we propose the P4Bldg ontology. A taxonomy for products which had been derived from ifcOWL4Add2 using the included python script.
